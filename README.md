- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Yaseen, a full stack developer who is passionate about building amazing web applications. When I'm not busy coding in HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, Flutter, Wordpress, and Python, I'm usually indulging my love for animes and books.

- I consider myself an intermediate level developer, but I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on new challenges. I'm particularly interested in the front-end development side of things, and love creating beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

- Aside from coding and sci-fi, I'm also fascinated by startups and the business world. I'm currently pursuing my BE in CSE from PDA College of Engineering, and hope to one day start my own tech company.

- Thanks for checking out my profile, and may the code be with you!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me - s.yaseendev@gmail.com. Fun fact: if you email me after 10 pm, there's a good chance I'll respond with a bleary-eyed message that may or may not make sense.
